			Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered feature that helps users browse the web more efficiently. Copilot can be
			accessed in the Microsoft Edge sidebar. You can ask complex questions, find comprehensive answers, summarize
			information, and find inspiration—just like you can when using Copilot in Bing. When using Copilot in Edge,
			you can also ask questions based on the page content or a PDF open in the browser. In the Compose tab, you
			can generate text, emails, social media posts, or ideas.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			To use the Microsoft Copilot, you need to start the Edge browser and click on the Copilot icon that is on
			the top-right corner. You may ask Copilot to do anything in English or Chinese. Type or say your
			question/request to see what will happen. (click on the mic icon first if you want to talk to Copilot)
		</p>

		<p>
			You can ask Copilot to read the text you provided aloud.
		</p>
		<p>In the following example (image on the right), you ask Copilot to read a
			paragraph of your lesson text. Just type “请把下面这段话读一下” and then copy and paste the paragraph. The Copilot
			will answer you in text and you need to click the speaker icon to hear it. (it can’t change the reading
			speed now) The reading is pretty good, very close to a native speaker’s reading.

		<h2 class="page-title2">Text-to-Speech Browser Extension</h2>
		<p>
			Speechify is a free text-to-speech screen reader available to many popular browsers, like Edge, Chrome,
			etc. To add it to your browser, just Google “speechify extension” to find out the details. When the
			extension is added to your browser, you may ask it to read the highlighted text of a web page. You can
			select different voices (Chinese Famale, etc.) and adjust the reading speed. The reading is pretty good,
			very close to a native speaker’s reading.

		<p>
			There are many text-to-speech browser extensions available. I tried a few, like Read Aloud, Natural
			Reader, etc. I recommend Speechify. It’s more user-friendly and has many features that come with the
			free version.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are two speechfy text to speech extensions. You may find the extension for other browsers too.
